Hello, I am Nick!
</p>

<p>
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics at UCLA and I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UCLA.

At present, I am working under the supervision of Professor Guang Cheng at the Trustworthy AI Lab at UCLA. My research interests lie in the methodology and applications of synthetic data, in particular through the lenses of robustness, fairness, and differential privacy of machine learning models. Specifically, I am investigating the paradigm of privacy auditing, which refers to investigating the true privacy level of different data synthesis methods, specifically the risk of membership inference and other attacks on generative models in an adversarial framework and how this risk depends on various factors. Related to the above, I am also interested in generative modeling methods more broadly (reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.).
