- 👋 Hi, I’m @nicklauskim
- 👀 I’m interested in applications of mathematics and statistics to the world of tech and big data, particularly machine learning. I have always thoroughly enjoyed math and stats and am always looking to grow my programming abilities, so studying the various methods of data science and their implementations in code has become the ideal way for me to indulge in intertwined two passions of mine.
- 🌱 I am starting a Master in Statistics (M.S.) program at UCLA in Fall 2021. I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, also at UCLA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in either Python or R that emphasize statistical modeling, data analysis, and machine learning
