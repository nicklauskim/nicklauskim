Hello, I'm Nick and welcome to my website!

I recently graduated from UCLA with a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics and am currently looking for full-time data scientist/data analyst roles. I have experience in machine learning research in various domains, mostly in academic environments, and I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UCLA.

Most recently, I performed research on topics in generative AI at the Trustworthy AI Lab at UCLA. My research emphasized the methodology and application of synthetic data to improve modern statistical/ML models, particularly in terms of robustness, fairness, and differential privacy. Specifically, I investigated the paradigm of privacy auditing -- investigating the true privacy offered by different data synthesis methods, specifically under the risk of membership inference attacks and other attacks on generative models, in an adversarial framework. <!--While much of my focus was on the evaluation of such synthetic data methods, I am also interested in generative modeling methodology as a whole (reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.).-->

Please feel free to check out the Projects tab for some examples of my work from grad school and research. Also check out the Blog tab for some ramblings on both stats and ML-related topics and stuff I'm interested in on the side, from the intersection of math and sports to foreign language learning to who knows what.
