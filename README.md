## 🧠 About Me

I'm a data scientist and researcher with a passion for creating **impactful, intuitive, and beautiful** data solutions.

I recently earned my **Master of Science in Statistics** from UCLA and am actively seeking full-time roles in **data science, analytics**, or **research-focused positions**, especially in the **public sector or mission-driven orgs**.

I specialize in:
- **Python, R, SQL** for data manipulation and modeling  
- **Dash, Streamlit, Plotly, ggplot2** for rich, interactive dashboards  
- **Statistical modeling, privacy-aware ML**, and **spatial analytics**

Most recently, I conducted research at the **UCLA Trustworthy AI Lab**, where I explored **generative AI and synthetic data**, focusing on privacy auditing, fairness, and robustness in data-driven systems.

🧪 My thesis investigated privacy vulnerabilities in synthetic health datasets, including **membership inference attacks** and **auditing frameworks** for generative models.
