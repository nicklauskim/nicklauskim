Hello, I'm Nick and welcome to my GitHub page!

I recently graduated from UCLA with a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics and am currently looking for full-time data scientist/data analyst roles in the public sector. I have experience in statistical research in various domains, mostly in academic environments, and I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UCLA. I specialize in Python, R, SQL, and Dash, and I have particular interest in creating stunning data dashboards and visualizations, statistical/machine learning, and spatial statistics, among other topics.

Most recently, I performed research on topics in generative AI at the Trustworthy AI Lab at UCLA. My research emphasized the methodology and application of synthetic data to improve modern statistical/ML models, particularly in terms of robustness, fairness, and differential privacy. Specifically, I investigated the paradigm of privacy auditing -- investigating the true privacy offered by different data synthesis methods, specifically under the risk of membership inference attacks and other attacks on generative models, in an adversarial framework. <!--While much of my focus was on the evaluation of such synthetic data methods, I am also interested in generative modeling methodology as a whole (reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.).-->

Please feel free to check out my website !(nicklauskim.github.io)[https://nicklauskim.github.io] for some examples of my previous work from grad school and research. Thanks!
