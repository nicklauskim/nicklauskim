Hello, I am Nick!
</p>

<p>
I am currently pursuing a Master of Science (M.S.) in Statistics at UCLA with an expected completion date of June 2023. I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UCLA in 2020.

At present, I am working under the supervision of Professor Guang Cheng at the Trustworthy AI Lab at UCLA. My research interests lie in the methodology and application of the use of synthetic data, in particular through the lenses of robustness, fairness, and differential privacy of statistical models and deep learning frameworks. Specifically, I am investigating the paradigm of privacy auditing, or in other words, investigating the true privacy level of different data synthesis methods, specifically, the risk of membership inference and other attacks on generative models in an adversarial framework and how this risk depends on various factors. While much of my focus is on the evaluation of such synthetic datasets, these evaluation results naturally influence and inform the creation of new mechanisms, so I am also interested in generative modeling methods as a whole (reinforcement learning, large language models, etc.).

Please also check out my blog (link at the top of the page) for some ramblings on assorted stuff I'm interested in, from side projects using data science to solve real-world problems to NLP and linguistics to who knows what.
