Hello, I am Nicklaus Kim!
</p>

<p>
I will steadily be moving all of my posts and content from my previous website (www.nicklausjkim.com - now defunct) to this new GitHub Pages site. I will also work on getting ALL of my coding projects on my GitHub profile. I know, I am late to the train; but hopefully you bear with me as I tweak this website and my Github to reflect <i>100%</i> of my academic/professional work and software development interests.
</p>

<p>
I am pursuing a Master in Statistics (M.S.) at UCLA with an expected completion date of Spring 2023. I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics at UCLA (2020).
</p>

<p>
I’m interested in applications of mathematics and statistics to the world of big data and machine learning, particularly booming subfields such as computer vision and natural language processing. As a big math nerd who is always looking to improve my programming abilities, studying the various theoretical methods of data science and their implementations in code has proven to be the ideal intellectual playground.
</p>

<p>
I’m always open to collaborating with others at a similar skill/knowledge level on projects in Python or R that emphasize statistical modeling, data analysis, and machine learning concepts.
