👋 Hi, I’m @nicklauskim!

👆I will be steadily moving all of my posts and content from my previous website (www.nicklausjkim.com - now defunct) to this new Github Pages site. I will also work on getting ALL of my coding projects on my Github. I know, I am late to the train; but hopefully you bear with me as I tweak this website to reflect 100% of my academic/professional work and software development interests.

👀 I’m interested in applications of mathematics and statistics to the world of tech and big data, particularly machine learning and its booming subfields such as computer vision and natural language processing. As a big math nerd who is always looking to improve my programming abilities, studying the various methods of data science and their implementations in code has proven to be the ideal intellectual playground.

🌱 I am starting a Master in Statistics (M.S.) program at UCLA in Fall 2021. I previously earned a B.S. in Applied Mathematics, also at UCLA.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects in Python or R that emphasize statistical modeling, data analysis, and machine learning concepts.
