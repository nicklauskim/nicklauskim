## Summary

I recently completed my M.S. in Statistics at UCLA and am currently searching for research-oriented statistician or data scientist/analyst opportunities, particularly in the public sector. I’m passionate about using my mathematical background and programming skills to build tools like data dashboards and web applications and production-level statistical learning models. I have experience in statistical and machine learning research in academia and a diverse set of data analysis/science skills In particular, I specialize in:
- Reproducible data workflows in **Python, R, and SQL**
- **Statistical modeling**, **machine learning**, and **spatial data analysis**
- **Data visualization** and **Interactive dashboards** using Dash, Plotly, and Streamlit
- **Privacy-aware modeling** and synthetic data evaluation

I recently conducted research at the **UCLA Trustworthy AI Lab**, developing tools to audit privacy risks in synthetic data models — especially in the context of **generative models** in the healthcare domain.
